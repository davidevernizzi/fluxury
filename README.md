fluxury - latest
================

Version 2.0.0 no longer use grunt for the build process, nor backbone, for data
modelling. Instead, it uses npm as a build tool, and immutable-js for state
management.

If someone is interested in the initial application with grunt and backbone, one should check out the tag v0.2.

The template contains an implementation of Dartlang's [Avast, Ye Pirates](https://www.dartlang.org/codelabs/darrrt/) written in flux.
